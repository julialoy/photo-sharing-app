# Hoard Pics Photosharing App

## Background/About
Hoard Pics was created to allow users to share their family photos and videos with select family and friends.

* Photostream organized by year and date the photo was taken (via Masonry)
* Add, edit, and delete photo descriptions and dates
* Tag photos with a specific name
* Edit user account settings
* Invite individuals to view photos or collaborate

* React
* React Router Dom
